# Intro To AI - Practice Problems

This practice is to help you get familiar with writing prompts for generative
AI tools. You will tackle problems and scenarios where you must meet their
requirements with the outputs of a generative AI tool.

Some of these problems may be familiar to you from earlier content. This should
allow you to focus most of your efforts on composing effective prompts for
completing each task.

**Which generative AI tool you decide to use is left to your discretion.**

## Discussion period after practice

At the conclusion of this practice period you will break out into groups to
discuss what you have learned, what worked and what did not, and how you might
apply these strategies to your future projects.

## Setup

- Download the files from the practice starter following the link at the bottom.

## Tips for writing good prompts

- **Prioritize clarity and specific instructions**: The more specific you are
  with your prompts, the more likely you will get the results you want. This may
  require writing multiple prompts to get the results you want.

- **Use delimiters to help focus tasks**: The use of delimiter comments can help
  you focus your prompts on specific tasks. This can help you avoid getting
  results that are not useful to you.

  Examples of delimiters:

  ````plaintext
  - Triple backticks: ```
  - Triple quotes: """
  - Angle brackets: <>
  - HTML/XML tags: <tag></tag>
  ````

- **Ask for specific structured outputs**: By specifying the format and
  structure of the output you want, you can help ensure you get the desired
  results.

  Examples of structured outputs:

  ```plaintext
  - JavaScript
  - React component
  - JSON
  - CSS
  ```

- **Few-shot prompting**: Giving examples of the desired output can help the AI
  tool understand what you want.

Practice makes perfect. The more you experiment with these tools, the more you
will learn how to best take advantage of them.

## Phase 01 - Coding problems and scenarios

In the **phase-01** folder you will have a series of problems and scenarios to
solve. Follow the directions in the **README-phase-01.md**. They will encourage
you to try a variety of strategies in order to get a generative AI tool's
outputs to completely meet their requirements.

**None of these problems will have specs or local tests. You are expected to
use the AI tools at your disposal to create these as well.**

Some of these problems may seem non-challenging (or challenging) to accomplish
with the help of AI. If you have only been solving them with one generative AI
tool, consider trying an alternative one to see if your results differ.

Because advancements are being made so quickly, some of these AI tools may
prove more effective in certain scenarios compared to others. It is possible
you will also develop a preference for one over another with enough practice.

After you have sufficiently explored these problems, move onto the next phase.

## Phase 2 - Practicing React with generative AI

This phase will have you attempting to complete a React practice you have
previously encountered during your time at a/A. However this time **you are
challenged to write as much code as possible utilizing the outputs of a
generative AI tool**.

Consult the **README-phase-02.md** for more details.
